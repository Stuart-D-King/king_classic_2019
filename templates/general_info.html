      <h4>Rules & Format</h4>
			<div class="boxed">
	      <p>The highest score you can card is +5 on a hole. Putt everything out. If you hit a ball off the green stuff but think you can find, look for it and if you don't find it, just take a lateral drop. However, if you blow one out into the desert or OB, you'll need to re-hit. You are permitted to bump the ball from a divot in the fairway, but play everything else down.</p>
	      <p>You must play all six rounds to be eligible to win the King Classic and have your name on the trophy. The winner will have the lowest <b>net score</b> over six rounds.</p>
				<p>Initial handicaps must be verified, but do not need to be official. There are several free apps that will calculate a handicap for you. <a href="https://www.thegrint.com/" target="_blank">The Grint</a> and <a href="https://www.swingbyswing.com/" target="_blank">Swing by Swing</a> are a few good ones. Please submit a screenshot of your handicap by August 1st.</p>
				<p>During the trip, if you better your handicap by four or more on any two consecutive rounds, your handicap will be adjusted down by two. For example, if your handicap is 12 and you shoot 80 or better two times in a row, your handicap will be adjusted to 10. Similarly, if you miss your handicap by eight or more on two consecutive rounds, your handicap will be adjusted up by two. For example, if your handicap is 12 and you shoot 92 or worse two times in a row, your handicap will be adjusted to 14. You can check what your handicap will be before each round <b><a href="{{ url_for('handicaps') }}">here</a></b>.</p>

	      <p><b>Skins</b> and <b>closest to the pin</b> are mandatory. Skins are based on net low score, and are $5 per round and then split among the participants based on the number of skins won. Please note that if your handicap is greater than 18, for the skins game (and only for the skins game) your handicap will be adjusted to 18. Closest to the pin is $2.50 per round, and the hole has been pre-selected and identified above.</p>
	      <p>Alex is the bank, so settle up with him. The total for 6 rounds is $45 ($5 x 6 = $30; $2.50 x 6 = $15; $30 + $15 = $45). If you don't already have it, download and install <a href="https://venmo.com/" target="_blank">Venmo</a> on your phone to make money exchange quick and easy. If you don't use Venmo, please bring cash and pay Alex before play begins. He will settle up with you in the same manner that you use to buy in (i.e. Venmo or cash).</p>

	      <p>Each round an individual player will put in $10 ($60 total for the trip). At the <b>end</b> of each round, all 10 players will draw a number from a hat to see who their partner was for the round. The top three two-man teams with the lowest <b>net</b> combined score will win the cash prizes accordingly:</p>
	      <p>First place: $50</p>
	      <p>Second place: $30</p>
	      <p>Third place: $20</p>
				<p>Ties will result in the splitting of the relevant prizes. For example, a two-way tie for first will see those two teams each winning $40 ($50 + $30 = $80 / 2 = $40), with the third place team winning $20.</p>
